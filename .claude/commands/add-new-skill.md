# /add-new-skill

Use this workflow when working on **add-new-skill** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new skill to the codebase, typically as a new agent capability or workflow module.

## Common Files

- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create a new SKILL.md file under skills/ or .agents/skills/ or .claude/skills/
- Document the skill's purpose, usage, and configuration.
- Optionally update manifests or documentation if the skill is significant.

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
