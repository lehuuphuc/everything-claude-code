# /add-or-update-skill

Use this workflow when working on **add-or-update-skill** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new skill or updates an existing skill, including documentation and registration in manifests.

## Common Files

- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `manifests/install-modules.json`
- `manifests/install-components.json`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create or modify SKILL.md in skills/<skill-name>/ or .agents/skills/<skill-name>/
- Update manifests/install-modules.json and/or manifests/install-components.json to register the skill
- Update AGENTS.md, README.md, and docs/zh-CN/AGENTS.md for documentation and agent tables
- Optionally add or update reference files or assets under the skill directory

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
